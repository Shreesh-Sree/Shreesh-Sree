# 👋 Hey, I'm Shreesh

I build things with code, break them, fix them, and repeat.  
Focused on **software engineering**, **machine learning**, and building products that actually ship.

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- 🧠 Machine Learning & AI (practical, not just notebooks)
- 💻 Software & Full-Stack Development
- ☁️ Cloud, APIs, DevOps basics
- 🎨 Side interest: clean UI, visuals, and creative tech

I like systems that scale, code that’s readable, and ideas that solve real problems.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages**
- Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, C

**Frameworks & Tools**
- FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit
- React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- Docker, Git, GitHub
- VS Code, Linux

**Data / ML**
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Computer Vision, Regression, Classification
- Model deployment > just model accuracy

---

## 📌 Current Focus
- Becoming a solid **software engineer who understands ML deeply**
- Building end-to-end projects (backend → frontend → deployment)
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code
- Learning by doing, not just watching tutorials

---

## 🧩 Projects
You’ll find:
- ML apps with real deployment
- Full-stack web projects
- Experimentation with APIs, automation, and AI tools

Most repos are work-in-progress. That’s intentional.

---

## 📈 Philosophy
- Simple > Fancy  
- Shipping > Perfect  
- Consistency beats motivation  

---

## 🤝 Let’s Connect
- GitHub: you’re already here
- Open to collabs, hackathons, and real-world problem solving
