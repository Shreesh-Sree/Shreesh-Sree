# 👋 Hi, I’m Shreesh

Software Engineering–focused Machine Learning enthusiast building end-to-end, real-world systems — not just models that live in notebooks.

I care about **clean code**, **practical ML**, and **shipping things that actually work**.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 AIML Engineering student
- 💻 Strong interest in Software Engineering + ML systems
- 🧩 I enjoy designing systems, APIs, and workflows more than chasing benchmarks
- 🚀 Focused on learning by building, breaking, fixing, and improving
- 📈 Long-term goal: become a strong engineer who understands ML deeply, not the other way around

I believe good engineering is boring, readable, and reliable — and that’s a compliment.
